# Durable unresolved-decision lifecycle

This skill is the single policy owner for unresolved captain decisions discovered by an investigation or visual review.

## Policy

Every unresolved decision that belongs to the captain and is discovered while producing, reading, presenting, or ending an investigation or visual review must become a structured captain-held work item in the authoritative backlog of the home that owns the originating work before that work or review may be treated as complete.
The agent performs the semantic inventory because scripts must not infer decisions from report prose, visual-review artifacts, terminal output, or chat.
Give each distinct unresolved decision a stable privacy-safe key, register it through `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh hold`, and use the same key on retry so registration is idempotent while that hold is still live; a decision that has already been closed keeps its identity permanently, so a genuinely new decision needs a new key.
After inventorying the whole report and review surface, run `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh complete` with every unresolved key, or with `--none` only when the reviewed surface contains no unresolved captain decision.
A completed investigation and an ended visual review use this same owner and completion command; a visual tool, including Lavish, never owns a parallel completion policy.
Run the command in the originating work's authoritative `FM_HOME`; main-home work creates main-home holds, and secondmate-owned work creates holds in that secondmate home's backlog rather than copying them into the main backlog.
Do not close a hold merely because the originating investigation completed, its report was archived, its visual review ended, or its task was torn down.
The hold remains the authoritative Captain's Call item until the captain's answer is durably recorded.
When that answer authorizes work, dependent work is created in the same backlog and `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh resolve` clears its hold edges before closing the decision.
When the answer routes no follow-up work, `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh decline` records that exact answer and closes the hold without inventing a task.
A hold closed outside this owner stays incomplete until `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh repair` records the answer, and neither unrouted path may stand in for work the captain actually authorized.
Resolved findings, recommendations that need no captain choice, and prose that merely sounds decision-like do not create holds.
Bearings reads the resulting structured state and must never compensate by scraping historical reports, visual-review artifacts, terminal output, chat, or other prose.

## Operating sequence

1. Read the complete investigation result and complete the visual review before declaring either complete.
2. Inventory only genuine unresolved choices that require the captain.
3. For each choice, choose a stable key and use the script's `hold` command with a concise title, reason, and repository.
4. Run the script's `complete` command with the full unresolved-key inventory for that review pass.
5. Relay the choices to the captain as decisions from Bearings' Captain's Call section under `AGENTS.md` section 9; do not use the word hold in captain chat.
6. After the captain decides, record any authorized dependent work with normal tasks-axi commands and block it by the hold identity.
7. Put the captain's exact durable decision in a file and use `resolve` with every routed task, `decline` when the answer routes none, or `repair` only for an already-closed captain hold.
8. Confirm Bearings no longer shows the closed hold and that routed work remains in structured backlog state.

`bin/fm-decision-hold.sh --help` owns command syntax, identity construction, completion attestation, retry behavior, and close ordering.
`docs/decision-hold-lifecycle.md` records the mechanism and regression evidence without restating this policy.
