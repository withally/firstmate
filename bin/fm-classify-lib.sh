# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, and the working/paused classification
# that makes stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
#
# There are four documented exceptions. The absorb classification
# (crew_absorb_class and its working/paused wrappers) is NOT a pure status-file
# read: it reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call,
# to decide whether a crew that went stale is working, deliberately paused, or
# neither. Callers run it only on stale handling, never on every wake, so triage
# stays cheap. status_open_decisions_incremental (see "incremental (cursor-backed)
# open-decisions fold" below) also writes: it persists a per-status-file byte
# cursor and folded open-set as a side effect, so a per-drain fleet-wide scan
# stays bounded by new appends instead of re-reading each task's whole lifetime
# log every time. status_append_is_captain_relevant can write a candidate
# per-task signal open-key snapshot when its caller supplies one; signal triage
# promotes that snapshot with the corresponding seen marker and never uses the
# drain cursor. crew_worktree_written_since reads the task's meta file and walks
# a bounded slice of its worktree instead of a status file, so callers run it only
# at the moment they would otherwise escalate.

# --- durable keyed decisions ------------------------------------------------
#
# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins
# (last_status_line above) cannot represent "an earlier decision is still open
# after a later, unrelated event": a subsequent done/paused/working line silently
# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative
# statement of the status-fold contract that fixes this - a needs-decision/blocked
# line OPENS a keyed decision, and only an explicit resolution or a verified
# captain-held backlog transfer referencing that key CLOSES it; a later unrelated
# terminal line never clears an open captain decision.
# Who WRITES the closing line is owned elsewhere: the answering firstmate closes
# at answer time through fm-send's --resolve-key (bin/fm-send.sh header), and a
# worker self-closes only a blocker that cleared without an answer (bin/fm-brief.sh
# rule 6), so closure never depends on a busy worker's discipline.
#
# Decision key grammar (backward-compatible with the existing "<verb>: <note>"
# format): an OPTIONAL "[key=<slug>]" token names the decision. Its documented
# position sits between the verb and the colon, and a complete token at the
# head of the note is accepted as an EQUIVALENT position, because that
# misplaced-colon shape is common real worker output whose stated key must
# never silently collapse into the shared "default" bucket (issue #2109):
#   needs-decision [key=api-shape]: <summary>
#   needs-decision: [key=api-shape] <summary>
#   resolved       [key=api-shape]: <how it was decided>
# Both positions state the same key and yield the same note (a consumed
# note-head token is key metadata, stripped from the note); when both positions
# carry a token, the documented before-colon one wins and the note-head token
# stays note text. A token deeper inside the note is prose, never a stated key,
# so a summary merely MENTIONING "[key=x]" cannot open or close that decision.
# A line with no token in either position uses the key "default", preserving
# the historical one-open-decision-per-task behavior (a bare "resolved:" closes
# "default"). A stated key whose slug fails the charset below is rejected (the
# folds skip the line), never rewritten to "default".
# The parsers are pure reads of a single line. Status metadata may contain any
# number of "[name=value]" tags before the colon, in any order, so verb parsing
# ends at the first tag rather than special-casing "[key=...]".
#
# Correlation tokens. That bracket rule already covers every BRACKETED tag,
# including the "[corr=<16 hex>]" form bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh writes. It
# does not cover the UNBRACKETED token that bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh writes
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token), which a secondmate answering a marked request
# echoes on its parent status line ahead of the key tag (bin/fm-brief.sh), so a
# real transition routinely arrives as
#   needs-decision corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <summary>
#   resolved       corr=<16 hex> [key=texte-du-mur]: <how it was decided>
# and a recovery turn can leave two such tokens on one line. All of those must
# read as the bare verb, in BOTH directions: a verb parse that keeps the token
# glued on matches no arm of _fm_decision_fold_line, so the opener never opens
# and the closer never closes, and a captain decision goes silently missing.
# Recognition starts only AFTER the retained leading verb: a token-first line
# keeps that token, so its following word cannot impersonate a transition and
# close a decision the captain is owed.
#
# The token grammar is OWNED by bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh
# (fm_pending_reply_corr_token, FM_PENDING_REPLY_CORR_RE). That library sources
# this one, so it cannot be sourced back here; the pattern below is a deliberate
# second statement of the SHAPE alone, and tests/fm-classify-corr-token.test.sh
# pins the two together through the real writers so they cannot drift.
#
# Recognition is deliberately narrow: EXACTLY the token that writer emits, whole
# word, and nothing else. An arbitrary "<name>=<value>" token is NOT skipped.
# Skipping unknown tokens would be the permissive road - it would let any
# free-text word carrying an equals sign ("resolved x=1 [key=k]: ...") reduce to
# a bare verb and impersonate a transition, which is the takeover the strict
# parse and _fm_decision_key_transition_allowed exist to prevent. Recognising
# only what a firstmate library actually writes costs one more line here each
# time a real new token shape is introduced, and that is the intended trade: a
# new shape is a deliberate, reviewed edit rather than a silent widening. A line
# whose token is malformed, wrong-length, or merely mentioned in prose keeps its
# extra words and therefore stays a non-transition, exactly as before.
#
# The 16 hex classes are written out literally rather than built from a
# variable, the same way bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh validates the id it is
# handed: a variable holding a glob is only re-read as a pattern under some
# shells' expansion rules, and a safety parse must not turn on that.

# --- incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold ------------------------
#
# status_open_decisions above re-reads and re-folds a status file's ENTIRE
# lifetime on every call, so its cost grows with total log size. A per-drain
# fleet-wide scan using that whole-file function would pay that cost for every
# task on every wake, which grows unbounded as tasks run longer and accumulate
# status history. status_open_decisions_incremental and scan_open_decisions_incremental
# below are the bounded-cost siblings used for that per-drain path: each call
# reads only the bytes appended to a status file since its own last call (a
# persisted per-file byte cursor) and folds just those new lines into a
# persisted running open-set, via the exact same _fm_decision_fold_line rule
# status_open_decisions uses - so the two strategies can never disagree on what
# is open. Cost is bounded by NEW appends since the last drain, not by the
# status file's total lifetime size.
#
# Correctness invariant (unchanged from the whole-file fold): an open decision
# is dropped ONLY by an explicit resolved/captain-held line for its exact key,
# never by cursor advancement, age, or being buried under later appends - the
# persisted open-set carries every still-open key forward across calls
# regardless of how much new unrelated log content has since been folded in.
#
# The cursor format is `version`, `offset`, `ident`, then the folded open set.
# FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION must be bumped whenever
# _fm_decision_fold_line semantics change, so persisted state from an older
# interpretation is discarded and rebuilt from byte 0.
#
# Cursor invalidation is deliberately minimal, matching how status files are
# ACTUALLY used in this repo: every one is created once (`>`) and only ever
# appended to (`>>`) - never replaced, renamed, or rewritten in place. So the
# ways a cursor can go stale are a fold-version mismatch, a shrink (truncated),
# or the file at this path being a different file than before
# (replaced/rotated/recreated), which a changed device+inode makes an O(1) check
# via a single `stat` call - no content hashing, no re-reading the consumed
# prefix. Any signal falls back to a full re-fold of the whole current file from
# byte 0 - byte for byte what status_open_decisions itself would compute - and
# rewrites the cursor from that clean baseline. A same-inode, same-size,
# in-place byte edit is NOT detected; that is a deliberately accepted gap
# because no code path in this repo ever does that to a status file.
#
# The other real failure mode is OUR OWN read failing (a stat/wc/tail I/O
# error), not a malformed writer: every such read here is checked, and on
# failure this reports the already-trusted persisted set unchanged rather than
# risking a silent invalidation that would wipe it - never a bare "empty" as if
# nothing were open.
#
# Not a pure status-file read: this writes/rewrites the sibling cursor file as a
# side effect (state/.<task>.open-decisions-cursor), the library's second
# documented exception to the pure-read rule after crew_absorb_class. The write
# is atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash between calls leaves either the
# prior cursor or the new one, never a partial one. bin/fm-wake-drain.sh calls
# this only after releasing the wake-queue lock, so a hypothetical race between
# two overlapping drains can at worst redo a little folding work twice - never
# drop an open decision - because a losing writer's offset can only ever be
# equal to or behind an already-recorded byte position, and the next call
# re-derives from whatever offset actually landed on disk.

# --- unread status lines since the presentation cursor ----------------------
#
# The drain annotation historically printed only the newest status line, so a
# nonterminal append - including routine working, note, paused, or non-closing
# resolved events - could be buried under a later unrelated append. These events
# do not belong to the OPEN DECISIONS fold, so this surface owns their presentation.
# These helpers are the ONE owner of "what is still unread since the last drain
# presentation": one fleet manifest records each status identity and last-
# presented byte offset, and one atomic replacement commits only the contiguous
# status spans that were successfully presented. A quiet fleet scan leaves
# routine nonterminal bytes unacknowledged so a subsequently published signal can
# still annotate them. A missing manifest row or changed file identity is
# offset 0 for the current file, while malformed or unreadable cursor state
# aborts presentation without advancing any offset. A trusted cursor at EOF
# prints nothing, so already-presented bytes are not replayed as new. Teardown
# retires a task's manifest row with its status file, so reusing a task ID starts
# the replacement log unread at byte 0. Nonterminal status lines are the
# fleet-wide unread surface except a keyed resolution that closes an open
# decision, so attended progress absorbed without a wake remains visible at the
# next drain.

# Read the legacy per-task open-decisions cursor used to seed the presentation
# offset before the fleet manifest exists. A fold-version mismatch, identity
# mismatch, or offset past the current size falls back to 0. Never writes unless
# a caller explicitly requests a migration snapshot.

# behind a static pane - the 2026-08-14 case of eight consecutive possible-wedge
# escalations against a crew that was demonstrably working the whole time.
#
# 1 for every other outcome, including an id with no recorded worktree, a worktree
# that is gone, a missing anchor, and a walk that fails or finds nothing. Absence of
# evidence therefore always leaves the caller's existing escalation schedule
# untouched, so a crew that writes nothing still escalates exactly as before.
#
# A kind=secondmate task records a provisioned firstmate home, not a code tree, and
# such a home runs its OWN supervision inside it: its state/ directory churns a
# watcher beacon, pane hashes, and heartbeats whether or not the mate is producing
# anything, so a walk there would report liveness for a mate that has done nothing.
# Those homes are excluded outright rather than by pruning "state", which would also
# hide a legitimate source directory of that name in an ordinary worktree. The
# exclusion is a negative outcome like any other, so an unproductive mate keeps
# escalating on the caller's unchanged schedule.
#
# The anchor is the caller's own idle-window timer file, whose mtime already marks
# when the quiet window opened, so `-newer` needs no clock arithmetic, no temp
# file, and no portable mtime-setting. Not a pure status-file read (see the header):
# one pruned, depth-bounded, wall-clock-bounded walk per call, which callers must
# reach only when they are otherwise about to escalate, never on every poll. A walk
# that outlives FM_WORKTREE_WRITE_TIMEOUT is killed and reported as no evidence, so
# a hung mount costs the escalation nothing but the bound. -xdev holds that walk to the
# worktree's own filesystem rather than descending into a nested network or container
# mount, so a write that lands only under such a mount is one more negative outcome.
