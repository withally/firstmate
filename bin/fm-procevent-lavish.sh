# Lavish adapter for the generic process-to-event runner.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh arm <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh classify <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh terminal <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh source-acknowledgements
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh acknowledge <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh silent <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh answers <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh source-id <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh retire <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh poll <artifact.html>
#
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, missing, or unknown.
# poll       The registered listener command `arm` publishes, not a command to
#            run in a conversational turn. It runs the published blocking poll
#            and prints its response verbatim, absorbing only the one exact
#            transient interruption described below.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this Lavish source will never
#            produce another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit
#            keeps it armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/fm-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
# silent     Exit 0 when the captured result is a routine no-op the runner should
#            record and never announce; any other exit publishes the wake. This
#            is the generic no-op contract bin/fm-procevent.sh calls, and the
#            only place Lavish's notion of "nothing was said" is decided.
# source-acknowledgements
#            Declare the post-capture acknowledgement seam this adapter uses.
# acknowledge
#            After the runner durably captures a result, acknowledge its
#            delivery_id through Lavish. A result without delivery_id needs no
#            ACK and returns success for compatibility with older Lavish builds.
#
# AN EMPTY BOARD CLOSE IS NOT NEWS, and that is what `silent` exists to say.
# Closing a review surface that carried nothing is the single most common Lavish
# result: the captain reads a board, says nothing, and closes it. Announcing that
# put a wake in front of the handler whose entire content was that nothing
# happened. `silent` therefore holds one narrow, positively-determined shape -
# a session this adapter classifies `ended` that carries no queued content block
# at all - and every other result stays announced.
#
# Deliberately narrow, in both directions. A `Send & End` close carrying the
# captain's actual answer arrives as `status: feedback` with `session_ended`, so
# it classifies `feedback`, never `ended`, and is announced exactly as before; so
# is any `ended` result that still carries a `prompts` or `feedback` block, which
# the published poll is not expected to produce but which must never be dropped
# on that expectation. A `waiting` session, a `missing` one, an `unknown` or
# unreadable result, and any error all stay announced, because none of them
# positively proves nothing was said. Silence is only ever an absence this
# adapter can see in the result, never an absence it assumes.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# how to read a completed result, and acknowledgement of a durably captured
# delivery. Ownership, durable capture, publication, and restart recovery all
# belong to bin/fm-procevent.sh.
#
# `answers` is this adapter's half of the generic keyed-answer contract in
# bin/fm-procevent.sh. It reports what the captain actually chose, as
# `<task-id>\t<answer>\t<label>` lines, and stops there. It maps nothing to a
# task, records no decision, and closes nothing: a captain answer is not special
# to Lavish, so every rule about what a keyed answer DOES belongs to the one
# intake in bin/fm-captain-hold.sh, which the runner feeds. A Lavish review is
# just an ephemeral discussion format that happens to carry answers.
#
# Only rows tagged `choice` are read. A freeform captain message is prose that may
# contain anything, and must never be able to forge a decision key.
#
# It wraps the additive poll interface verified against the patched 0.1.50:
#   Usage: lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--ack <delivery-id>] [--agent-reply "..."]
# and that command "long-polls indefinitely" server-side. The adapter therefore
# runs the plain blocking form with no timeout flag, so results arrive as real
# server-side events. After durable capture, its ACK call uses the same command
# with `--ack <delivery-id> --timeout-ms 1`: Lavish completes the ACK before it
# begins that bounded follow-on poll, so command success confirms the ACK while
# any immediately returned newer delivery stays unacknowledged for redelivery.
# It adds no periodic discovery or timer fallback.
#
# BOUNDED QUIET RETRY, owned here and nowhere else. A live listener can be cut
# short by the server with exactly this two-line response while the session's
# marks remain available:
#
#   error: Lavish Editor poll response was interrupted
#   code: SERVER_ERROR
#
# That is an internal retry, not news, so registering the raw poll made the
# generic runner capture it and wake the whole fleet. `poll` therefore re-runs
# the published poll up to POLL_RETRY_LIMIT times for that exact response, with
# POLL_RETRY_DELAY_DEFAULT seconds between attempts. The match is exact and
# deliberately narrow: real feedback, ended and missing sessions, any other
# SERVER_ERROR, and the same interruption still standing after the bound is
# spent are all printed straight through and captured normally. The retry is a
# Lavish fact, so the generic runner in bin/fm-procevent.sh stays
# adapter-agnostic and learns nothing about it.
#
# DELIVERY GUARANTEE AND LIMITS, stated plainly. When a response carries a
# delivery_id, the runner stores the complete result before this adapter ACKs it,
# and capture failure or truncation sends no ACK. An ACK-command failure keeps
# the source armed for retry; because ACK is idempotent, this is safe even when
# Lavish applied an ACK whose response was lost. That closes the source-side
# handoff window with at-least-once,
# duplicate-tolerant delivery. Deliveries have no owner or TTL, so simultaneous
# or replacement consumers can process the same delivery; this is not exclusive
# delivery. Lavish persists state with plain writeFile rather than fsync plus
# atomic rename, so the guarantee does not cover torn writes or power loss.
# An older Lavish response with no delivery_id triggers no ACK and keeps the old
# behavior, including its destructive source-side loss window; never describe
# that compatibility path as at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless.
