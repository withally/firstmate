# fm-session-start.sh - one command for the whole session start.
#
# Collapses AGENTS.md sections 3 (bootstrap) and 5 (recovery) into ONE script
# producing ONE ordered digest, so a session starts in one or two turns
# instead of the six-plus separate reads the old docs required: run
# fm-bootstrap.sh, then separately read data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md,
# data/captain.md, data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md, then run
# fm-lock.sh, fm-wake-drain.sh, then read data/backlog.md, every state/*.meta,
# and every state/*.status.
# Every one of those reads is UNCONDITIONAL at every session start, so they
# belong in a script, not in N agent turns.
#
# COMPOSITION, NOT DUPLICATION: this script calls fm-lock.sh, fm-bootstrap.sh,
# and fm-wake-drain.sh as real subprocesses and prints their real output. It
# never re-implements their logic; all sequencing/formatting logic added here
# stays local to this file. Those three scripts remain fully working
# standalone with unchanged default behavior - other flows (fm-bootstrap.sh
# install <tools> after consent, /updatefirstmate, the afk daemon, existing
# tests) still call them directly. The one seam this script needed -
# bootstrap running its detect-only diagnostics without its six mutating
# sweeps - is an opt-in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 flag on fm-bootstrap.sh
# itself (default unset/0 = unchanged behavior), not a fork.
#
# ORDERING, and why LOCK now runs before BOOTSTRAP (the old AGENTS.md order
# was bootstrap-then-lock):
#
#   1. lock          - acquire the per-home session lock FIRST, before any
#                       mutating step runs.
#   2. bootstrap      - home-local stale Herdr projection cleanup runs only
#                       when this session actually holds the lock. Detect-only
#                       diagnostics always run. Bootstrap's six MUTATING sweeps
#                       (legacy PR-check migration, secondmate convergence,
#                       secondmate liveness, pending remote handoff retry,
#                       X-mode artifact writes, fleet sync) also run only when
#                       locked.
#   3. wake-drain     - mutates the durable wake queue, so it also only runs
#                       when locked.
#   4. supervision    - emit the operating block for the detected harness.
#   5. read-once      - state the contract governing all digest sources before
#                       any bulk data.
#   6. fleet digest   - a recovery-focused data/backlog.md listing, every
#                       state/*.meta, a line-count and per-line bounded status tail,
#                       state/.afk, and a cheap per-task endpoint-liveness read:
#                       read-only, always runs.
#   7. context digest - data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md, data/captain.md,
#                       data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md: read-only,
#                       always safe, always runs after live fleet identity.
#   8. closing reminder - prints the context-specific watcher next step; this
#                       script points back to the emitted harness supervision
#                       block and deliberately never arms the watcher itself.
#
# On a Pi primary, the supervision-block step also checks whether Pi's two
# tracked primary extensions are loaded and prints a PI_WATCH_EXTENSION
# reminder line when one is missing.
#
# Why lock first: the old documented order (bootstrap, THEN lock) let a
# SECOND concurrent session run bootstrap's mutating sweeps - converging
# secondmate homes, retrying pending handoff outboxes, writing X-mode artifacts,
# and fetching or fast-forwarding every project clone - before ever discovering
# another session already holds the lock. Two sessions racing those sweeps is
# exactly the hazard the lock exists to prevent, so locking first closes the
# hole outright: only the session that actually wins the lock ever touches
# shared mutable state.
#
# The tradeoff this ordering accepts: a refused (read-only) session must not
# go dark. So on refusal, bootstrap still runs (in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1
# mode) for its read-only detect lines - missing tools, gh auth, the
# worktree-tangle check, the harness override, crew-dispatch validation,
# tasks-axi and quota-axi tool checks, and tasks-axi availability - none of
# which mutate shared state and all of which are safe to compute without
# verified lock ownership.
# Only projection cleanup, the six bootstrap mutating sweeps, and the
# wake-queue drain are skipped.
# The context and fleet-state digests
# below are always read-only, so they run unconditionally in both modes.
#
# BACKLOG DIGEST: startup is a recovery surface, so done rows are omitted,
# every in-flight, held, and blocked row is retained, and only ready queued
# work is bounded by FM_SESSION_START_QUEUED_LIMIT (default 20).
# When compatible tasks-axi is selected and available, the shared tasks-axi
# backend probe remains the compatibility owner and this script asks
# `tasks-axi list` for the compact identity fields plus blocked_by, hold_kind,
# and hold_reason, never body.
# When manual mode is selected, or tasks-axi is unavailable or incompatible,
# this script prints only backlog section headings and item title lines, so
# title-line hold and blocked-by metadata remain visible while indented bodies
# stay out of the startup digest.
# Full bodies are targeted follow-up only: `tasks-axi show <id> --full` when
# compatible tasks-axi is available, or `data/backlog.md` when the file body is
# truly needed.
# Status-tail lines are additionally capped by bin/fm-line-cap-lib.sh, while
# the full status-log path remains beside every tail for targeted recovery.
#
# The whole digest is bounded by FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT (default 120s).
# When the bound is hit, the parent names the incomplete stage and all stages
# that were not reached while preserving output already emitted by the child.
#
# Usage: fm-session-start.sh [--reemit]
#   Prints the full ordered digest to stdout and always exits 0: this is a
#   reporting command, not a gate. A lock refusal is reported as a loud
#   banner inline, never a silent failure or a non-zero exit that would make
#   an agent skip the rest of the digest.
#
#   --reemit re-verifies lock ownership, reruns detect-only bootstrap, drains
#   queued wakes, and reprints the digest without repeating startup's mutating
#   bootstrap sweeps or stale Herdr projection cleanup.

Everything below is represented for this session start: every state/*.meta, a
compact data/backlog.md listing, a bounded tail of every state/*.status, and
the five context files. Do not re-read them after this digest or bulk-read the
backlog and status logs.

Read a source directly only when this digest marked it ABSENT or corrupt, a
specific full task body or older status history is needed, a capped line's
tail matters, omitted queued work is needed, or STARTUP TRUNCATED named the
stage that would have emitted it.
