# the deferred network stage a session start launches instead of running its
# network work on the blocking path.
#
# The session-start suite proves the digest no longer waits and that the deferred
# sweeps still land. This suite pins the stage's own contract, whose whole job is
# to make deferral safe:
#   - `start` returns immediately and does not hold the caller's stdout open,
#     which is what would strand a session-open hook behind the worker
#   - a durable acknowledgement after harvest prints a finished result suppresses
#     the wake, while an unacknowledged result always produces one
#   - mutating sweeps are refused when the fleet lock no longer names the session
#     that requested them, and the refusal is reported rather than silent
#   - the aggregate bound turns a wedged sweep into an actionable line
#   - an abandoned `running` record is reported as needing a rerun rather than
#     staying "in progress" forever
#   - single-flight: a second `start` never launches a competing worker
